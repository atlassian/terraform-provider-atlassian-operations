## v1.1.8

#### Product:

- Add `delete_default_actions` attribute in the API Integration resource. Fix Order attribute problem on Notification Policy and Alert Policy resources. Handle external deletion of resources by setting their state to Deleted on Read operations. This ensures that the provider can handle resources that have been deleted outside of Terraform, preventing state inconsistencies.
## v1.1.7

#### Product:

- Bug fix `delete_default_resources` attribute in the Team resource. List Schedules in paginated manner to find the default schedule and delete it if `delete_default_resources` is set to true. This ensures that the default schedule is removed when the team is created with this attribute set to true.
## v1.1.6

#### Product:

- Added support for the `delete_default_resources` attribute in the Team resource. This allows users to remove the default escalation and schedule for newly created teams. Be cautious, as this also changes the team routing rule to None, requiring you to define a routing rule separately.


## v1.1.5

#### Product:

- Fixed an issue where the "field" attribute of an Integration Action's Conditions attribute had an invalid validator, causing Terraform not to accept valid values.

## v1.1.4

#### Product:

- Fixed an issue where the api_key value was being removed from the state file (where it was previously present) after consecutive terraform apply runs.
  - This does not affect the api_key field in the resource, which is still only available after Create operations. Reading an existing integration will not return this field.

## v1.1.3

#### Product:

- Fixed an issue where the users were unable to create global alert policies.

## v1.1.2

#### Product:

- Fixed an issue where notification policy resources that don't specify the "not" parameter in the conditions clause caused an inconsistency error after applying. [JSDCLOUD-16983](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDCLOUD-16983)
