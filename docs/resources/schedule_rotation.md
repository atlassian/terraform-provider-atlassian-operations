### Required

- `schedule_id` (String) The ID of the schedule this rotation belongs to. This links the rotation to a specific on-call schedule.
- `start_date` (String) The date and time when this rotation begins, in RFC3339 format (e.g., '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z').

### Optional

- `end_date` (String) The date and time when this rotation ends, in RFC3339 format. If not specified, the rotation continues indefinitely.
- `length` (Number) The duration of each rotation shift in units matching the rotation type (hours for hourly, days for daily, weeks for weekly). Defaults to 1.
- `name` (String) The name of the rotation. Must be at least 1 character long. This helps identify the rotation's purpose.
- `participants` (Attributes List) The list of participants in this rotation. Can include users, teams, escalation policies, or empty slots (noone). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--participants))
- `time_restriction` (Attributes) Optional time restrictions for when this rotation is active. Used to define specific hours or days when the rotation applies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--time_restriction))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the rotation. This is automatically generated when the rotation is created.
