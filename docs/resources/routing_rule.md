<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `notify` (Attributes) Configuration for how incidents matching this rule should be handled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--notify))
- `team_id` (String) The unique identifier of the team that owns this routing rule. This field is required and cannot be changed after creation.

### Optional

- `criteria` (Attributes) The conditions that determine when this routing rule should be applied to an incident. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--criteria))
- `is_default` (Boolean) Indicates whether this is the default routing rule for the team. Default rules are used when no other rules match.
- `name` (String) A descriptive name for the routing rule. This helps identify the rule's purpose and should be unique within the team.
- `order` (Number) The order of the team routing rule within the rules. Order value is actually the index of the team routing rule whose minimum value is 0 and whose maximum value is n-1 (number of team routing rules is n).
- `time_restriction` (Attributes) Time-based restrictions for when this routing rule should be active. Allows defining specific time windows and days of the week. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--time_restriction))
- `timezone` (String) The timezone used for time-based routing decisions (e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Europe/London'). Must be a valid IANA timezone identifier.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the routing rule. This is automatically generated when the rule is created.

<a id="nestedatt--criteria"></a>
### Nested Schema for `criteria`

Required:

- `type` (String) The type of criteria matching to use. Valid values are: 'match-all' (matches all incidents), 'match-all-conditions' (all conditions must match), or 'match-any-condition' (any condition can match).

Optional:

- `conditions` (Attributes List) List of conditions that must be met for the routing rule to be applied. Required if type is 'match-all-conditions' or 'match-any-condition'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--criteria--conditions))

<a id="nestedatt--criteria--conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `criteria.conditions`

Required:

- `field` (String) The incident field to evaluate (e.g., 'message', 'priority', 'tags').
- `operation` (String) The comparison operation to perform (e.g., 'equals', 'contains', 'matches').

Optional:

- `expected_value` (String) The value to compare against the field value.
- `key` (String) If field is set as extra-properties, key could be used for key-value pair.
- `not` (Boolean) Indicates behaviour of the given operation.
- `order` (Number) Order of the condition in conditions list.



<a id="nestedatt--time_restriction"></a>
### Nested Schema for `time_restriction`

Required:

- `type` (String) The type of time restriction to apply. Must be either 'time-of-day' for daily recurring windows or 'weekday-and-time-of-day' for weekly schedules.

Optional:

- `restriction` (Attributes) Configuration for daily time windows. Used when type is 'time-of-day'. Specifies the same time window for every day. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--time_restriction--restriction))
- `restrictions` (Attributes List) List of weekly time windows. Used when type is 'weekday-and-time-of-day'. Allows different time windows for different days of the week. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--time_restriction--restrictions))

- `end_hour` (Number) The hour when the restriction ends (0-23, where 0 is midnight). Must be a valid 24-hour time.
- `end_min` (Number) The minute when the restriction ends. Must be either 0 or 30 (half-hour increments only).
- `start_hour` (Number) The hour when the restriction begins (0-23, where 0 is midnight). Must be a valid 24-hour time.
- `start_min` (Number) The minute when the restriction begins. Must be either 0 or 30 (half-hour increments only).
